We have all seen bad code, we have all written bad code, and we may have got some points deducted from our projects or homework because of it. Everyone has their own personal coding standards that have been developed over time. Whether we are the type to leave the “{“ on the same line or place the “{“ on the next or whether we are a two spacer, a four spacer, or a tabber for indentation, we have all followed a general outline on our coding standards and styles to allow us, our professors, and our group members, better understand the code we are writing so that we don’t have to waste precious time, and points, to help one another understand the mess we have created. In its essence coding standards allow blocks of code to be considered “human readable”, or the ability to be understood immediately by other programmers even if they are not of the same level. These coding standards include proper indentation, proper variable declaration, and proper function naming and all of these help the “readability” of the code. Here is an example of code that is readable and unreadable.

Although both codes achieve the same goal having proper indentation and figure brackets allow better readability and having proper variable names provide no ambiguity to what data is being stored. Thus, from having great readability there is great maintainability.

	  From our adventure in “Fixing Bad JavaScript” having a general coding standard allows a large group, our class for example, to be able to understand each other’s code and is a great boon for both our grader in class as well as being a great experience to force adjustment to our own personal coding standards. I do believe in the opinion that if you can only implement one software engineering technique to improve quality, it should be coding standards. Being able to write code in such a way that readability, maintainability, and portability is as important as achieving the initial goal of the program for the real world and tools like ESLint with IntelliJ is a very great combination to automate and force certain coding standards on people as no one wants to see red “x” anywhere in their program. Achieving the green checkmark is a goal in of itself and although frustrating at times I do see the usefulness.

	Speaking of portability, I have seen this first hand as taking the ICS212 Program Structure forced certain coding standards on myself to better help the portability of code between operating systems. Tabs on windows may not be the same as on other operating systems and thus if tabs were used in our source code the grader would see very, very, ugly indentation and made reading code unbearable to the point that if tabs were used in the source code we would be docked points immediately. So as part of the class coding standard we used 4 spaces for indentation as the space character is the same length in all operating systems.
	
	In conclusion, I do believe that having readable code is a must in all instances of programming and improves the most important part of long lasting applications being maintainability, portability can change depending on the client but I do believe that when someone begins to learn a new language in coding the first step is the coding standards.
