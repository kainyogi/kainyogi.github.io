Ever since a child I was introduced to a world of engineering. From having a father who moonlighted as a mechanic for all things metal and a mother who was very supportive of all my interests I began my path into the computer science field with fire in my eyes. This fire never died as all throughout growing up I have witnessed many advancements in computer science from using my first keyboard around the age of 6 to my first touch screen phone at the age of 14 to my first experience of VR at the age of 20 and I have never once thought that this was the end of the advancements as many companies both big and small push the limit of computer science. This taught me that this field is ever changing and will never be boring no matter the age. 

It wasn't only the mechanics or the brains behind the screen that interested me but what was on it as well. After experimenting in both high school and college I have developed a strong interest in UI design and front end development. With past projects I took on the UI coding and designing making sure that I can create the best that I can do at the time and making sure that I am always improving by researching and trying out other professional user interfaces just to experience what people can do on their level of programming and with new and upcoming technology such as touch screen tablets and computers to VR it has only cemented my interest in one day developing the best user interface for any occasion.

For now, however, I am continually learning. Making sure that I can learn the basic principles of all coding languages to use that as a stepping stone to more advanced practices. In the future, I do hope to improve my picture editting techniques, as you can tell with my project section, and be able to make my own assets for things such as video games or websites. Finally, I hope to experience what every professor has to offer by taking as many ICS courses as I can.
