In an ever-advancing world where people now have the internet in their pocket, problem solving has changed from being an arduous task to a simple Google search away. Often called Google-Fu, the skill of knowing exactly what to search can drastically decrease the time wasted to solve a problem and is especially true for any technical questions. However, there are many instances where the problems someone might face are too specific or unsolved and thus require that person to ask for assistance and for a very large range of Computer Programming topics there exists a platform where users can interact with experts and receive the help they need. This platform is called Stack Overflow and with over 16 million questions in a plethora of topics and many experienced experts providing answers to the topics, knowing what to ask and how to ask can lead to a better understanding of the topic for both the person asking the question and the expert.

Quoting Eric Steven Raymond, author of How to Ask Questions the Smart Way, “good questions are a stimulus and a gift. Good questions help us develop our understanding, and often reveal problems we might not have noticed or thought about otherwise.” Experts love good questions, and many sacrifice their time to answer these questions, but this time is very limited. As such, many of these experts developed ways to categorize the good questions from the bad so that their time isn’t wasted on something to trivial or something that won’t benefit the community as a whole. Here is an example of what is considered a “Bad Question” according to Raymond’s work.

According to Raymond’s work there are a lot of indicators of this being a “Bad Question.” First is the title, in Raymond’s work he mentions the title being a “golden opportunity to attract qualified experts' attention” and clearly stating the question with the problem and a description of the deviation in less than 50 characters is the best way to do this. This question is the opposite. This question lacks both the object and the deviation, the only thing the expert will know is that it will be dealing with JavaScript but no other information. Next, is that this user lacked to look at prior documentation or lacked to do prior research. This is a relatively easy question to answer with a simple Google search and is considered a waste of time that could be spent answering another. Finally, and possibly the simplest error to fix, grammar, which is self-explanatory. All of these put together creates this persona of this user that is very negative in the eyes of experts and results in an answer that will probably be negative and not as helpful. Low effort questions will most likely result in low effort answers and will not help the user develop skills in their topic. However, a “Good Question” will provide completely opposite result.

A “Good Question”, as shown above, will provide a satisfactory experience for both the user and the expert. According to Raymond’s “Before You Ask” section, there are 7 things a user can do to avoid before asking a bad question, and this user completed 4 things. This user stated clearly that he experimented with the code, searched the web, confided with other programmers, and read the API for this particular issue but unfortunately could not formulate a satisfactory answer and thus asked for help on an open source community. Unlike the previous question, this user’s title was clear and concise with no grammatical errors, had an object and a deviation spoken clearly, what code was being used and where, and was explicit in the question being asked. This is what is considered to be a “Good Question”, a question that not only provided the user with a satisfactory answer but allowed the experts to do their own research into the problem as they deemed it worthy of their time. The resulting answers were met with very informative responses along with links for further reading and provided a space where numerous experts provided examples for the codes use. This is best outcome to happen to a “Good Question” as the community as a whole was improved, the user achieved his or her goal of obtaining knowledge and the expert was able to possibly strengthen his understanding of such topic ready to answer this question in other areas of the web. 

In conclusion, although this is definitely not some in-depth study into asking good vs bad questions, this allowed me to see first-hand that it does make a difference. This has offered a large amount of insight into the open source community and a basis of how I can improve myself to ask or answer questions. As someone just now learning JavaScript as well as a student in college, I will definitely use the guidelines in Raymond’s work when I am asking any question whether it is technical or not.
