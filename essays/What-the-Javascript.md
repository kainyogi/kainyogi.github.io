Javascript so far has been an experience. Having absolutely no background knowledge of JavaScript, I have been uncovering new ways to efficiently code in JS everytime I learn something new through the code camp. Compared to other coding languages such as C/C++ or Java I would say the general idea of coding is the same but some of the syntax is completely different.In fact, handling arrays, declaring variables, and the conditions all have completely confused me while learning them, especially the new condition added, the "===" sign. Maybe I am currently naive or just stubborn but there exists a condition that already checks for equality and that is == so then why is there an additional equality check with an extra = sign. After googling and completing the 106 code camp lessons I have a weak grasp of the concept but it only has made me a bit more confused on variable declaration. In other codes you must declare a variable with the correct declaration, int for integer and char for character, but in JS there is no declaration rules, the let and const declarations handle all types of variables and to me that is just bad syntax. However, in all I do believe JavaScript can do things better than other codes but it can do way worse in many more cases and is a necessary evil in Web Development.
