Javascript so far has been an experience. Having absolutely no background knowledge of JavaScript, I have been uncovering new ways to efficiently code in JS everytime I learn something new through the code camp. Compared to other coding languages such as C/C++ or Java I would say the general idea of coding is the same but some of the syntax is completely different.In fact, handling arrays, declaring variables, and the conditions all have completely confused me while learning them, especially the new condition added, the "===" sign. Maybe I am currently naive or just stubborn but there exists a condition that already checks for equality and that is == so then why is there an additional equality check with an extra = sign. After googling and completing the 106 code camp lessons I have a weak grasp of the concept but it only has made me a bit more confused on variable declaration. In other codes you must declare a variable with the correct declaration, int for integer and char for character, but in JS there is no declaration rules, the let and const declarations handle all types of variables and to me that is just bad syntax. However, in all I do believe JavaScript can do things better than other codes but it can do way worse in many more cases and is a necessary evil in Web Development.

For the class structure of 314, for now, I am adjusting. It is definitely different from other classes in the ICS department I have taken and I can already feel the potential workload from this class but I do find it enjoyable. It teaches me to learn code on my own and at a reasonably fast pace, other classes force you to sit through classes where you might already know the topic both inside and out, such as in ICS111, but this class tests your skills in self-teaching as not knowing the most efficient way to do simple functions will definitely hurt in WODs. Speaking of WODs, or more specifically, the practice WODs, has been a really excellent teaching technique. It allows me to use my skills of JS and efficient coding techniques to complete a given task in a setting where it feels more relaxed. Although the first actual WOD gave me a shock to my nerves, these WODs and this style of learning is allowing me to ease myself into it. As such, in the Fibonacci Euler Project I actually had to do some pseudocoding first to get an idea where to start, this took up the most time however allowed my programming speed to make up for it, only to get the wrong answer, if this was an actual WOD I wouldnt have known that and I wouldnt have personally improved in my knowledge of JS. It is because of this that I believe the practice WODS will, eventually, make me the best I can be during the actual WODs.

In all, JavaScript and the Structure of 314 is very complimentary. JavaScript is both difficult and a breeze as is this class so far, they both can surprise you with errors or large workloads, and they both are necessary for any career path in Computer Science. For now I do feel overwhelmed in the workload but by this time next week, my rythym will a smooth beat.
