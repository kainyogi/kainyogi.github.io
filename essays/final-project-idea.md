<h3>OVERVIEW</h3>

 The problem: Many students must go out of the department for certain general education credits and often times because of the wide plethora of classes in UHM many students don't exactly know what is being offered to them to fit those credits
 
 The solution: This website will the a tool that will assess the student based on certain interests and past classes where they found the topics interesting and will generate lists and pseudo-schedules that the student can use to decide what classes to take.

<h3>APPROACH</h3>

To use this web-app, the student must login and set up a profile. The profile enables multiple ways to input interests, past classes with a rating system that provides weight to classes that they liked more, and a short rating system based on the professor that is teaching it to match the students prefered teaching style. Upon completing the forms and submitting data the web-app will locate classes that match interests and generate a list so that the student can further narrow the scope of classes they want to take. The class list will also have public ratings from other users possbily from the same major so they can make a more educated decision.
